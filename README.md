# Brief instructions for the package CoExpROSMAP.

ROSMAP is a project you can access from here <https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3219045>. It includes transcriptomics from more than 600 samples. Using the package <https://github.org/CoExpNets> we created four co-expression networks for them.

# Introduction

This package can be used through the `CoExpNets` package to access and analyze these networks and to create new ones. 

In the package you will find networks for the following tissues
```r
library(CoExpNets)
library(CoExpROSMAP)
CoExpROSMAP::initDb()
getAvailableNetworks()
```

`[1] "notad"      "probad"     "ad"         "allsamples"`

Each network is compound of
* An RDS file with the network itself. When reading the object you obtain a list with `moduleColors` and `MEs`, the clustering of nodes and the module eigengenes respectively.
* A csv with the enrichment for the modules from the Gene Ontology, REACTOME and KEGG pathway annotation databases.
* The residuals (corrected by PMI, Age, Gender and Batch, with ComBat) and Surrogate variables with SVA.

## Install the development version from GitHub:

Recommended that you install first CoExpNets
```r
devtools::install_github('juanbot/CoExpNets')
```
And then this package

```r
devtools::install_github('juanbot/CoExpROSMAP')
```
